This is a library to parse MathType's MTEF binary format. Currently doesn't do very much at all.

My intention is that it should read the MTEF stream and, as a bare minimum, output an XML serialisation of it with each
MathType record mapping fairly directly to an XML element containing subrecords as subelements, and with record options
represented by attributes. As an extension, it could make the XML a bit nicer (e.g. instead of outputting a TMPL element
for the TMPL record, it could output a specific element based on the template selector).

Ultimately, I'd like to be able to convert a binary MTEF stream into presentational MathML. My thinking is that once
the binary MTEF is available in some kind of XML representation, it turns into a question of XSLT which personally I
find more tractable (and it can be tested with XSpec tests).

At the moment, this is my main project for working on in my spare time and on the train to / from where I work.
Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of spare time currently! All contributions and suggestions are welcome, but
my ability to respond is a bit limited at the moment.

My intention is to put this under the Apache License, version 2.0, unless anyone has any serious objections.
